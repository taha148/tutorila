// A function is a block of code that performs an action or returns a value.
//  Just like how arrays in JavaScript have
//  built-in methods that perform tasks, functions can be thought of as custom global methods. 
// Functions are reusable, and can therefore make your programs more modular and efficient.
// Initialize greeting function
function greet() {
    console.log('Hello, World!')
  }
  greet()

  greet('Sammy')
